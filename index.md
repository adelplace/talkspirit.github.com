# Welcome to the talkSpirit API

You'll find here documentation, guides and blog posts to start working with talkSpirit.
The Incoming Webhooks are currently the solution to communicate with the 
talkSpirit API. More API will be available later.<br>
If you don't already have one, you can [create a new account here][signup], 
[create an Incoming Webhook integration][create-webhook], grab the token and 
start to send posts.

Let's jump right in!
